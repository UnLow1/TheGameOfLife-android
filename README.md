# TheGameOfLife-android
The Game Of Life for Android devices. Based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

## Installation
* Download and install on your device TheGameOfLife.apk  
OR
* Import project and run it in Android Studio

## Rules:
Any cell could be live - green or dead - red.

  1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
  2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
  3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
  4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
  
Player can score points by choosing cells that will change their state. Every correct pick will give you +1 point but incorrect pick -1. Round counter will stop when game detects no state change. Screens with short example below.
